      <h2 class="hidden">About</h2>
      <p class="text_column">Sophie Bushman is a web designer from Denver, Colorado. She currently resides in Brookyln, New York. She started coding in high school. Then she studied marketing for a semester of college. Then she studied web design at the New York Code and Design Academy. That's what she's doing now. </p>
      <p class="text_column">Sophie mostly freelances. But that's not a stable income and she has cats to provide for (and an overly dependent relationship with seamless), so she took a job as the content and web assistant for blogger Eva Amurri Martino. She gets to work from home and eat pizza in bed all day while making pretty websites and creating super cool code.  </p>
      <p class="text_column">Sometimes she likes to look at things other than her computer screen. So when shes not working, she likes to play roller derby, eat tacos, hang out with her cats, and galavant around NYC</p>

        <p>For local small business, Patient Advocate Nurse: Denver. This was made using squarespace. It is simple, functional, and pretty. It has a minimalist feel to clearly display all of their services and information. </p>
